# Concat Crusaders – The Array Unifiers

It’s time to unite two arrays into one! As a Concat Crusader, you must use the built-in concat method called as `concatCrusaders` to combine two arrays into a new array, leaving the original ones untouched. No mutation allowed!

### Example Operation:

```js
concatCrusaders([1, 2], [3, 4]);
// Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

concatCrusaders(["a", "b"], ["c", "d"]);
// Output: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
```
